## Unit 4
- [**Text files**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reading-writing-text-files-python/)
- [**CSV**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/working-csv-files-python/)
- [**JSON**](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_json.asp)
- [**Errors**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-exception-handling/)


**PS:** I changed the order of the syllabus, because I'm not fucking mental like the people who made this curriculum. Who teacher text files, then goes to teaching error handling and comes back to CSV Files.

**PS2:** When I was about 16, I made an awful website where you can view all the programs for grade 12 taught at out school. I still use it because it has programs for file handling which are actually pretty well made: [AC12P](https://ac12p.netlify.app)
